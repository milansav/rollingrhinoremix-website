                            Rolling Rhino Remix is an unofficial Ubuntu flavour which converts the Ubuntu operating system into a rolling release Linux distribution by
                            tracking the devel series. <br></br>
                            A rolling release distribution is a Linux distribution which receives continuous package updates,
                            and as such there are no major updates (unlike Ubuntu's current release model where there is clear progression between versions).
                            A rolling release model offers new and experienced users a new way to utilise their desktop PC, without the hassle of major upgrades.

                    Rolling Rhino Remix might be for you!

                    We work hard to ensure that Rolling Rhino Remix has the best possible user experience.
                    We have created tools and additional repositories to ensure that Ubuntu works smoothly as a Rolling Release distribution.

                                Rolling Rhino Remix provides many different quality of life and command-line utilities to
                                improve the user experience of the Operating System. Many of these utilities were created by
                                the Rolling Rhino Remix team specifically for the distribution.
                                You can find information about each of the utilities on our

                                Rolling Rhino Remix has partnered with two large open source projects, Pacstall and Nala.
                                Pacstall is an AUR-like package manager that brings the experience of the Arch User repository to Rolling Rhino Remix.
                                Nala is a <span class="code">libapt-pkg</span> frontend which improves the experience of the apt package manager with better output,
                                parallel downloads and transaction history.

                        We have created our home-grown utility called Rhino. Rhino has three commands,
                        <span class="code">rhino-update</span>, <span class="code">rhino-deinst</span> and <span class="code">rhino-config</span>.

                        <span class="code">rhino-update</span> is our extensible update utility, which will ensure that the system is updated smoothly.
                        Due to the extensibility of it, you can use <span class="code">rhino-config</span> to configure the updates you can receive.
                        You are able to use this tool for an ever-increasing list of features,
                        such as enabling the installation and upgrades of the latest Linux kernel,
                        removing and replacing snapd with Flatpaks and enabling Pacstall on your system.

                        <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://pacstall.dev/" target="_blank">Pacstall</a> is an AUR-like package manager
                        for Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based systems, and we have worked closely with the Pacstall developers to integrate it into our distribution.
                        Pacstall brings the experience of the Arch User Repository directly to
                        Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based systems with an ever-growing number of user-maintained packages.

                        <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://gitlab.com/volian/nala" target="_blank">Nala</a> is a libapt-pkg
                        front-end which improves the core functionality of apt.
                        We have (once again) worked closely with the developers of Nala to integrate it into Rolling Rhino Remix.
                        Nala provides functionality such as transaction history, parallel downloads and better output formatting.
                        Nala makes apt much more user-friendly as a result of this.
                        Please read our <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://github.com/rollingrhinoremix/docs/wiki/nala" target="_blank">Nala documentation</a> to

                        We have our own Terminal User Interface (TUI) utility to install desktop environments.
                        This makes the installation of desktop environments on a minimal installation of Rolling Rhino Remix
                        significantly easier. All that is required is to run <span class="code">rhino-deinst</span>, select the
                        Desktop Environments or Window Managers you wish to install and the utility
                        will do the rest. Deinst will also automatically install and enable the required Display Manager.
